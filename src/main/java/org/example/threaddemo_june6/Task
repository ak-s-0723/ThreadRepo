FIND OUT SUM TILL N NUMBERS AND THIS SUM WILL BE PRINTED BY SOME THREAD (NOT MAIN)

Thread pool is a place where i keep my threads and if there is any task , my thread can
just a pick task from there and start executing it.

Executor Service or Executors is implementation of Thread Pool in Java
-> FixedThreadPool -> number of threads will be fixed in this case when we create
                      Executor Service object
-> CachedThreadPool -> if all the threads are busy and there is a need of a thread,
                       it will create a thread, otherwise it will use the idle thread.
